1)	What is java script?
It is used to convert static page into dynamic page. It is a booming programming language.

Variables in js;
Set of block used to store data
Data is nothing but datatypes
Primitive datatype
Numbers, string, bool, undefined, null, big it
In the end of the day all the java script is treated as an object.
In java script variables are dynamic in nature.(no need of mentioning the data type).
eg: var  a=10

Scope
1) Global: If we declare outside function then we cannot access inside
2) Local-scope/script-scope: we declare any function inside so we can’t access it outside
3) Block scope: inside a block

        Variables are 3 types:
	var
	let 
	const

Static type and dynamic type:
1) variables
2) Variables are used to store the data (any kind of data)

3)var uses only old browsers


1)	Reassigning the variables:
var fav_std=”ramya”
 fav_std=”kavya”
fav_std=”sam”
document.write(fav_std);
console.log(fav_std);
o/p:sam

Example2:




Output:10
1)Reassigning variables is possible by var
2)Reassigning with let is acceptable
3)Reassigning with const not acceptable

Redeclaring with var is accepted:
Example:
var a=1;
var a=5;
document.write(a+a)
Console.log(a+a)

o/p:10

Redirected with let is not acceptable:
       Example:
       let a=1;
          let a=5;
         document.write(a+a);
        console.log(a+a)
o/p: error

Block scope:
Variables declared  with var does not have block scope
